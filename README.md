The user can hold the data of the students and books both. You can perform various actions like issuing a book or returning a book updating new books data and similarily many actions can be done for students data as well. A student can check how much fine to be paid if delayed.
A librarian can access both the data files while a student can't access the books data or make any changes in the books data. Those changes can only be done by a librarian.
